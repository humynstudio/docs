Humyn gives PMs a continuous feed of customer voice without running a fresh survey every week. Use this playbook to move from fuzzy feedback to prioritized roadmap moves.

## 1. Align on the question

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Define the business goal" icon="target">
    Are you validating a roadmap theme, sizing a pain point, or pressure-testing positioning? Write the question in the project description.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pick comparison sets" icon="scale-balanced">
    Track your product alongside 1–2 competitors or substitutes so you can show relative sentiment, not just absolute noise.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## 2. Gather the right conversations

| Step | What to capture | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seed keywords | Feature names, common objections, “wish it had…” phrases. | Align themes with product requirements. |
| Save threads | Release notes, beta feedback, community rants, review site comments. | Blend praise and friction for a balanced view. |
| Tag personas | Note whether the voice is power user, new customer, or evaluator. | Tailor recommendations by audience. |

## 3. Turn noise into prioritization signal

- Filter Explore by persona or keyword cluster to isolate a single job-to-be-done.  
- Use **Top Quotes** to anchor every product requirement in verbatim feedback.  
- Track sentiment shifts week over week—if frustration grows, elevate the issue in roadmap reviews.

<Callout>
Create a saved view named `Roadmap Evidence` and pin the most important themes. Revisit it before every sprint or quarterly planning meeting.
</Callout>

## 4. Share the plan with stakeholders

1. Draft a feature brief using Chat to synthesize “What users are saying” + “What we will build.”  
2. Export a CSV or copy the timeline into Linear/Jira to back backlog grooming with data.  
3. Present the highlights in product review with three elements: user quote, theme summary, proposed action.

## 5. Measure adoption after launch

- Run the same keyword set post-release to check for sentiment swings.  
- Capture quotes that celebrate or criticize the change and feed them to design, support, and marketing.  
- Use the Generic workflow loop to keep the analysis running while you shift focus to the next bet.

<Tip>
Pair this workflow with metrics dashboards (activation, retention) to show how qualitative and quantitative signals agree—or diverge.
