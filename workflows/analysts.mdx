# Analyst Workflow

Whether you cover public markets, category trends, or competitive intel, Humyn helps you separate speculation from sustained signal.

## 1. Define the coverage universe

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pick tickers or topics" icon="chart-line">
    List the symbols, categories, or product launches you want to monitor—e.g., `NVDA`, “AI productivity tools,” or “fintech onboarding.”
  </Card>
  <Card title="Identify community hubs" icon="people-group">
    Add the subreddits, Discords, and forums where your audience congregates. Prioritize channels with depth, not just volume.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## 2. Build a repeatable intake

| Cadence | Inputs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily | High-impact news threads, price-move discussions, rumor mill posts. | Capture breaking sentiment. |
| Weekly | “State of the market” megathreads, founder AMAs, review roundups. | Track sustained narratives. |
| Monthly | Industry reports, conference chatter, macro discussions. | Contextualize long-term conviction. |

## 3. Surface leading indicators

- Use **Explore** to sort by keywords like “sell,” “switching,” or “lagging” to flag negative inflection points.  
- Watch mention frequency—spikes often pre-date interest from mainstream media or analysts.  
- Tag quotes with impact level (high/medium/low) to focus research time on the strongest signals.

<Callout>
Set up a `Watchlist` project for each sector and reuse the same keyword templates. Consistency makes quarter-over-quarter comparisons effortless.

## 4. Package insights for decision makers

1. Ask **Chat** for a briefing that answers “What changed in the last 7 days?”  
2. Pull top quotes into your market note or internal Slack digest—keep the original community voice intact.  
3. Translate qualitative shifts into actions (“raise risk flag,” “add to diligence backlog,” “monitor again next week”).

## 5. Validate and archive

- Compare Humyn sentiment with price, funnel, or usage metrics to cross-check the signal.  
- Bookmark critical quotes inside Humyn so you can cite them in future investment memos.  
- Archive each cycle’s findings in your research repository for pattern matching later.

<Tip>
If you support multiple teams (finance, product, strategy), create separate views per stakeholder so each receives the angle that matters most.
