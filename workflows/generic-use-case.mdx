This workflow is the baseline loop we recommend for any team adopting Humyn. It balances signal intake, synthesis, and sharing so you can prove value in a single sprint.

If you only follow one playbook, make it this one—the same structure scales to new personas, product lines, and markets without rework.

## 1. Frame the mission

- Record the outcome you want: e.g., “Improve onboarding for self-serve buyers” or “Benchmark competitor perception before launch.”  
- Capture the data ingredients: relevant subreddits, must-track keywords, and any posts from your support queue or community forum.  
- Add context in your project description so future collaborators understand the why behind the scan.

## 2. Source conversations intentionally

| Action | Detail | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seed keywords | List 5–8 phrases that reflect intents, pain points, or product names. | Project lead |
| Save URL lists | Paste Reddit threads, forums, and long-tail blog comments you already monitor. | Research partner |
| Schedule refresh | Decide how often you’ll add new URLs (daily for launches, weekly for ongoing monitoring). | Whole team |

## 3. Cluster insights quickly

1. Open **Explore** once ingestion finishes.  
2. Filter by the newest time window to highlight fresh conversations.  
3. Pin themes that match your mission (e.g., “pricing confusion”, “AI skepticism”).  
4. Tag quotes with sentiment so you can pull them into decks without re-reading every thread.

<Tip>
Keep a running document (Notion, Coda, or Linear) with three sections: “What we learned”, “Signals to validate”, and “Decisions we made.” Tether each bullet to a Humyn quote.
</Tip>

## 4. Share the story

- Use **Chat** to generate a crisp summary that ties your pinned themes together.  
- Export the highlights to your internal doc or slide template.  
- Include 2–3 quotes in the original community voice—stakeholders trust the raw language.

## 5. Close the loop

- Log any follow-up questions that surfaced during reviews.  
- Schedule the next intake cycle and adjust keywords/URLs based on what resonated.  
- Track the downstream impact (tickets resolved faster, demo win rate, roadmap decisions) so Humyn’s value stays visible.
