Humyn’s visual identity leans on calm gradients, rounded corners, and ample white space. Use the assets in this repository to keep every surface consistent across docs, marketing, and product training material.

## Available assets

- `/images/hero-light.png`: Primary hero for light backgrounds. Preferred for documentation and marketing landing pages.
- `/images/hero-dark.png`: Alternate hero for dark or mixed backgrounds. Works well in slide decks.
- `/images/checks-passed.png`: Product UI close-up highlighting moderation and approval states.
- `/logo/light.svg` and `/logo/dark.svg`: Wordmark optimized for respective modes.

<Callout>
All image assets live in the `/images` and `/logo` directories. Keep filenames predictable; we reserve camelCase for UI exports and kebab-case for marketing composites.
</Callout>

## Usage guidelines

1. **Respect padding.** Maintain at least 32px of whitespace around logos and hero art so the gradients stay clean.
2. **Prefer local assets.** Host imagery from this repo to avoid regressions when third-party CDNs change URLs.
3. **Optimize for size.** Keep PNGs under 500 KB. If an export exceeds that, re-run it through ImageOptim before committing.
4. **Stick to the palette.** Primary blue `#2563EB`, accent sky `#60A5FA`, deep navy `#1E3A8A`, and the neutral slate background `#F5F8FF`. Do not introduce off-brand gradients.

## Embedding in MDX

Use the built-in Markdown syntax for simple screenshots, and drop down to JSX only when you need custom styling.

```md
![Feedback Hub overview](/images/checks-passed.png)
```

```jsx
<img
  src="/images/hero-light.png"
  alt="Humyn Studio dashboard with highlighted insights"
  style={{ borderRadius: "1rem" }}
/>
```

<Tip>
Need something that isn’t here? Ping the design team in `#brand-lab` with your use case so we can ship a vetted asset instead of improvising.
