## Who should use this

Founders, product, research, and GTM leads running their first Humyn implementation. The cadence below mirrors how our earliest beta teams launched.

## 4-week roadmap

| Week | Focus | Primary owner | What “done” looks like |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Strategy alignment | Founder / Product | Shared goals, target communities, success metrics. |
| 2 | Source onboarding | Research / Ops | Prompts live, community list finalized, saved searches created. |
| 3 | Insight delivery | Narrative lead | First dashboard view, spotlight insight, stakeholder share-out. |
| 4 | Enablement | GTM / CS | Playbooks published, team training, feedback loop defined. |

## Essential assets

- **Kickoff brief** — Why Humyn, desired outcomes, who owns what.  
- **Prompt bank** — Approved prompts for personas, objections, and opportunities.  
- **Insight template** — Standard format for weekly recaps (title, why it matters, quotes, next steps).  
- **Stakeholder deck** — 5-slide overview for leadership updates.

## Operating cadence

- **Daily stand-up (10 min):** Surface wins, blockers, new themes spotted overnight.  
- **Weekly sync (30 min):** Review dashboard, approve next prompts, assign follow-ups.  
- **Asynchronous thread:** Dedicated Slack/Discord channel (#humyn-signal) for real-time drops.  
- **Monthly retro:** Evaluate impact, adjust taxonomy, capture customer quotes worth amplifying.

## Risk mitigations

1. Confirm permissions for scraping or storing public community data.  
2. Back up prompts, tags, and saved searches before major iterations.  
3. Align on who filters out low-signal or off-brand conversations.  
4. Maintain a single source of truth for decisions so insights don’t disappear into DMs.

## Metrics to watch

- Time to first insight published.  
- Number of bookmarked threads or quotes shared with leadership.  
- Active contributors per function after week two.  
- Stakeholder confidence rating (quick weekly pulse).

## Keep iterating

Embed this playbook in your internal wiki and update it after each launch cycle. Share feedback or refinements with the Humyn team so we can fold improvements back into the beta program.
