## How to Shape the Roadmap

1. Share ideas in the Discord channel or email `support@humyn.studio`.  
2. Include context: which personas benefit, the workflows impacted, and sample threads validating the need.  
3. Upvote existing requests—community signal keeps us aligned with the most valuable outcomes.

We review feedback every week during product planning and update this page after each milestone cycle.
