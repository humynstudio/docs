## Guiding principles

1. **Show, don’t tell** — Lead with real quotes and dashboards that make the value obvious.  
2. **Meet teams where they work** — Pipe insights into Slack, Notion, Linear, or decks.  
3. **Tight feedback loop** — Collect reactions to each share-out and fine-tune prompts and tags.

## Playbooks by function

### Product & Design

- Host a weekly “signal stand-up” reviewing the Dashboard heatmap and Explore highlights.  
- Tag roadmap ideas with supporting Humyn threads so prioritization debates stay grounded.  
- Capture before/after sentiment for each release and share in sprint reviews.

### Research & Insights

- Maintain the prompt and taxonomy library; audit summaries for accuracy every Friday.  
- Publish a Friday recap with top quotes, emerging opportunities, and recommended next digs.  
- Run monthly office hours to coach new stakeholders on asking great Hue prompts.

### Marketing & GTM

- Use Hue to draft messaging experiments, then A/B test with conversational snippets.  
- Equip sales with objection flashcards sourced directly from community conversations.  
- Trigger renewal or expansion alerts when Humyn surfaces account-specific risk signals.

## Communication toolkit

| Channel | Purpose | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slack/Discord channel | Real-time drops, escalations, celebrations | Insights lead |
| Notion/Confluence hub | Playbooks, taxonomy, approved prompts | Product ops |
| Weekly Loom | 5-minute breakdown of what changed and why it matters | Narrative lead |
| Executive digest | High-signal summary with next decisions | Founder / Product leader |

## Adoption metrics

- **Weekly:** Active contributors, saved views created, Hue prompts used.  
- **Monthly:** # of decisions influenced, campaigns launched, roadmap changes informed.  
- **Quarterly:** Executive satisfaction score, retention impact, trend reversals.

## Continuous improvement

- Retrospect quarterly on what content landed vs. what was ignored.  
- Invite stakeholders to co-create new prompts or metrics during strategy offsites.  
- Share wins in the Humyn Discord so other teams can replicate your approach.
