## Why measure

Humyn surfaces stories; measurement translates those stories into executive-ready proof. This framework helps you quantify speed, quality, and business impact so renewals, expansion, and investment conversations are straightforward.

## Impact pillars

1. **Velocity** — Time saved on research, synthesis, and storytelling.  
2. **Quality** — Decisions influenced, campaigns optimized, roadmap bets validated.  
3. **Outcomes** — Retention lifts, win rates, community growth, earned media moments.

## Reporting architecture

| Artifact | Audience | Cadence | Format | Signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder pulse | Founders / Execs | Weekly | Slack/Loom | Top 3 insights, blocker alerts, emerging bets. |
| Product scorecard | Product & Design | Bi-weekly | Dashboard view + doc | Theme momentum, quote highlights, follow-ups. |
| GTM enablement digest | Marketing / Sales | Weekly | Email/Notion | Messaging wins, objection handling, content angles. |
| Quarterly narrative | Board / Investors | Quarterly | Deck | Macro trends, impact metrics, customer quotes. |

## Data sources to blend

- Humyn dashboard exports, Explore bookmarks, Hue transcripts.  
- CRM or CS platforms for revenue and renewal indicators.  
- Product analytics to show adoption changes tied to insights.  
- Campaign tooling (HubSpot, Webflow, Framer) for messaging experiments.
