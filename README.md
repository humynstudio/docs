# Humyn

Hi, this is a WIP.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The project bundles the latest Mintlify CLI, so the Willow theme and Humyn configuration load without relying on a global install. Use `pnpm build` for a production export and `pnpm lint` before opening pull requests.
