# Roadmap

We build Humyn to uncover <mark>real community insight</mark> for builders, strategists, and researchers. The roadmap below reflects what’s in motion right now. Add your voice in `#product-feedback` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bycbt28zpk) or email `support@humyn.studio`.

Timelines represent earliest release targets. We adjust as customer signal, data quality, and compliance needs evolve.

## How to Shape the Roadmap

1. Share ideas in the Discord channel or email `support@humyn.studio`.  
2. Include context: which personas benefit, the workflows impacted, and sample threads validating the need.  
3. Upvote existing requests—community signal keeps us aligned with the most valuable outcomes.

We review feedback every week during product planning and update this page after each milestone cycle.
