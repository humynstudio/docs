## Why it matters

Feedback Hub gathers every Reddit comment, forum reply, and uploaded transcript into a single table. Tag, sort, and score each item so product, research, and marketing teams stay aligned on the raw voice of the customer.

## Key fields

- **Username & source** — Track where the conversation started and who said it.  
- **Feedback** — Full text with automatic summaries to skim faster.  
- **Engagement** — Gauge traction by upvotes, replies, or shares.  
- **Confidence** — Record how trustworthy the signal is after human review.  
- **Status** — Flag items you’ve triaged, assigned, or sent downstream.

## Typical actions

| Action | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Apply filters | Focus on specific personas, product areas, or sentiment. |
| Save a view | Build reusable boards for roadmap grooming or research syncs. |
| Send to Hue | Kick off follow-up questions without leaving the table. |
| Export rows | Drop curated feedback into decks, briefs, or CRM notes. |
