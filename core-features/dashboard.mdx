## What the dashboard delivers

The Dashboard is your living status page for community signal. Instead of hopping between Explore, exports, or Slack threads, every spike, sentiment shift, and winning quote meets you here.

## Tile anatomy

| Tile | Use it to | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Conversation Volume** | Validate the sample size behind your weekly readout. | Helps leaders see the dataset before they see the conclusion. |
| **Theme Momentum** | Track which topics accelerated, cooled, or emerged from nowhere. | Perfect for setting sprint priorities or campaign pivots. |
| **Signal Mix** | Balance praise, blockers, questions, and objections. | Highlights when sentiment flips before dashboards catch up. |
| **Quote Highlights** | Pin context-rich statements for storytelling. | Keeps roadmaps, briefs, and decks anchored in verbatim voice. |

## How to work the Dashboard

1. **Filter with intent.** Narrow by project, persona, or time range so you’re evaluating the exact audience and period that matters.  
2. **Save reusable views.** Create presets like `Weekly Product Sync`, `Investor Digest`, or `Launch Retro` so every team stays aligned.  
3. **Export and embed.** Drop PNG snapshots into slides or export CSVs for deeper analysis in Sheets or BI tools.  
4. **Schedule digests.** Set up email or Slack summaries to broadcast key shifts automatically.

<Tip>
Pair scheduled digests with a Slack channel like `#humyn-signal` so spikes never live in just one person’s head.
</Tip>

## Keep it trustworthy

- **Assign an owner.** Pick someone to review tile accuracy weekly and tune filters as projects evolve.  
- **Spot-check sentiment.** Open sample threads from Quote Highlights to confirm the tone classification still holds.  
- **Retire clutter.** Archive views that no longer drive decisions so teams focus on what matters.  
- **Document your taxonomy.** Define theme names and tags in your internal wiki so everyone speaks the same language.
