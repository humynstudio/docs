## Why it matters

The dashboard is the first stop for founders and operators who want a pulse on what communities are saying. It bundles trending themes, sentiment shifts, and standout quotes so you can sync with stakeholders in minutes—not hours.

## Core tiles

- **Conversation Volume:** Track how many Reddit threads, tweets, and comments Humyn ingested over your selected window.  
- **Theme Momentum:** Surface the topics that are accelerating or cooling week over week.  
- **Signal Mix:** Understand the balance between praise, questions, pain points, and objections.  
- **Quote Highlights:** Pin community statements that deserve airtime in your next share-out.

## Working the dashboard

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Filter by community, persona, or time range | Zoom in on the audience that matters for today’s decision. |
| Save a dashboard view | Create reusable presets for stand-ups, board updates, or launch retros. |
| Export a snapshot | Drop PNGs or CSVs into decks, Notion pages, or investor updates. |
| Schedule digest emails | Keep founders, GTM, and design in the loop automatically. |

> **Operator tip:** Pair the dashboard with Slack digests so important spikes are impossible to miss.

## Keeping it trustworthy

1. Assign an owner to review dashboard health weekly.  
2. Audit sample threads to confirm sentiment and tagging accuracy.  
3. Archive views that no longer drive decisions to keep things lightweight.  
4. Record glossary definitions for theme names so teams stay aligned.
