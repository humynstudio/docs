## Tile anatomy

| Tile | What it shows | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Comments ingested** | Count of fresh Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments Humyn processed for this project. | Confirms how much real conversation is backing the insights you’re about to share. |
| **Latest insight** | The most recent highlight or theme promoted to the Overview from Explore. | Gives you the headline story to anchor stand-ups and stakeholder updates. |
| **Latest sync** | Timestamp of the last successful data pull. | Lets you confirm you’re looking at today’s sentiment—not last week’s. |
| **Runs processed** | Number of ingestion jobs completed for the selected window. | Helps you spot if a scheduled pull failed or if multiple jobs are feeding the same readout. |
