## What Hue unlocks

Hue is your AI research partner. Instead of combing through dashboards, you can ask freeform questions and receive synthesized answers, quotes, and recommended next steps drawn from the latest community conversations.

## Prompt ideas

- “What are the biggest onboarding blockers founders mention this week?”  
- “Give me three quotes I can use to position our research workflow feature.”  
- “How do designers describe the ‘jobs to be done’ for AI productivity tools?”  
- “Summarize objections to annual pricing from enterprise buyers.”  

## Anatomy of a response

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Insight summary | A concise answer grounded in threads across Reddit, Twitter, or YouTube. |
| Supporting quotes | Direct statements you can copy into decks, briefs, or campaigns. |
| Suggested actions | Recommended follow-ups to explore in Explore, Metrics, or GTM tools. |
| Linked views | Quick links to the underlying conversations for deeper reading. |

## Usage patterns

- Prep for stakeholder meetings by gathering the freshest perspective on a topic.  
- Draft release notes, enablement scripts, and content angles in minutes.  
- Pressure-test ideas before you commit to a sprint or campaign.  
- Build a searchable library of approved prompts new teammates can reuse.

## Guardrails

- Avoid sharing sensitive or embargoed plans directly in prompts.  
- Review Hue’s citations before quoting in external materials.  
- Refresh prompts after major launches or taxonomy updates to avoid drift.  
- Capture feedback for the product team in the Humyn Discord.

## Connected workflows

- Convert answers into insight cards inside [Explore](explore).  
- Reference metrics to validate impact in [Dashboard](dashboard) and [Metrics](metrics).  
- Drop Hue transcripts into shared docs for async onboarding or retros.
