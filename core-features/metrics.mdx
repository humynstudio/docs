## Why Metrics exists

Metrics turns Humyn’s qualitative signals into leader-ready scorecards. It gives you north-star indicators you can bring to board decks, roadmap reviews, and GTM readouts without guessing.

## How it works

Humyn breaks every dataset into sentiment and aspect-driven slices so teams can see the “why” behind the numbers:

- **Sentiment mix** — Percent of comments labeled positive, negative, and neutral so you can quantify mood shifts over time.
- **Aspect insights** — Topic clusters such as “Features”, “Usability”, “Price”, and “Customization” that highlight what people focus on most.
- **Trend deltas** — Week-over-week changes that flag when enthusiasm spikes or friction grows.
- **Linked evidence** — Every metric anchors back to supporting quotes so you never lose the context.

## Build your Metric catalog

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose the decisions" icon="flag">
    Start with the questions leaders ask most: “Are launches moving the needle?”, “Where are we bleeding trust?”, “Which persona is surging?”
  </Card>
  <Card title="Define formulas" icon="calculator">
    Document the numerator, denominator, and filters for each metric. Keep it down to 3–5 KPIs per initiative.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Assign owners & thresholds" icon="user-shield">
    Clarify who watches each metric and when to raise a flag. Tie alerts to Slack or email so changes don’t get buried.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link to evidence" icon="link">
    Every tile should click through to Explore views or saved Hue prompts so teams can review the supporting quotes instantly.

## Sample metric set

| Metric | Formula | Refresh cadence | Primary consumer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signal Volume | Count of new curated conversations (Reddit/Twitter/YouTube) this week. | Daily | Product leadership |
| Positive Momentum | % of comments tagged “praise” or “adoption win.” | Daily | Exec updates |
| Blocker Density | High-severity objections ÷ total threads. | Weekly | Support & Ops |
| Launch Lift | Sentiment delta pre/post campaign. | Weekly | GTM & Marketing |

<Tip>
Mirror these KPIs inside Slides, Notion, or Mode dashboards so execs see the same numbers everywhere.

## Keep the system fresh

- Revisit formulas when you add a new persona, market, or product line.  
- Time-box reviews with owners—weekly for volatile launches, monthly for steady-state products.  
- Track a changelog of updates so your leadership team trusts the trend lines.
