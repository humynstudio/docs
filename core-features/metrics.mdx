## How it works

Humyn breaks every dataset into sentiment and aspect-driven slices so teams can see the “why” behind the numbers:

- <mark>Sentiment mix</mark> — Percent of comments labeled <mark>positive</mark>, <mark>negative</mark>, and <mark>neutral</mark> so you can quantify mood shifts over time.
- <mark>Aspect insights</mark> — Topic clusters such as <mark>Features</mark>, <mark>Usability</mark>, <mark>Price</mark>, and <mark>Customization</mark> that highlight what people focus on most.
- <mark>Linked evidence</mark> — Every metric anchors back to supporting quotes so you never lose the context.
