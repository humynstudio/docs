## Why Metrics exists

Metrics turns Humyn’s qualitative signals into leader-ready scorecards. It gives you north-star indicators you can bring to board decks, roadmap reviews, and GTM readouts without guessing.

## How it works

| Layer | What you see | Why you care |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KPI tiles | Volume, sentiment mix, blocker density, launch lift. | Gives execs a fast answer: are we trending the right way? |
| Drill-down panels | Supporting quotes, theme clusters, audience breakdowns. | Pairs the metric with direct evidence so trust stays high. |
| Alerts & trends | Threshold indicators and delta badges. | Surface inflection points before they become fire drills. |

## Build your Metric catalog

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose the decisions" icon="flag">
    Start with the questions leaders ask most: “Are launches moving the needle?”, “Where are we bleeding trust?”, “Which persona is surging?”
  </Card>
  <Card title="Define formulas" icon="calculator">
    Document the numerator, denominator, and filters for each metric. Keep it down to 3–5 KPIs per initiative.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Assign owners & thresholds" icon="user-shield">
    Clarify who watches each metric and when to raise a flag. Tie alerts to Slack or email so changes don’t get buried.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link to evidence" icon="link">
    Every tile should click through to Explore views or saved Hue prompts so teams can review the supporting quotes instantly.

## Sample metric set

| Metric | Formula | Refresh cadence | Primary consumer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signal Volume | Count of new curated conversations (Reddit/Twitter/YouTube) this week. | Daily | Product leadership |
| Positive Momentum | % of comments tagged “praise” or “adoption win.” | Daily | Exec updates |
| Blocker Density | High-severity objections ÷ total threads. | Weekly | Support & Ops |
| Launch Lift | Sentiment delta pre/post campaign. | Weekly | GTM & Marketing |

<Tip>
Mirror these KPIs inside Slides, Notion, or Mode dashboards so execs see the same numbers everywhere.

## Keep the system fresh

- Revisit formulas when you add a new persona, market, or product line.  
- Time-box reviews with owners—weekly for volatile launches, monthly for steady-state products.  
- Track a changelog of updates so your leadership team trusts the trend lines.
