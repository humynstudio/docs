## What Metrics does

Metrics transforms the qualitative insights Humyn surfaces into lightweight KPIs. It gives founders, product, and GTM leaders a clear lens on how community sentiment and activation efforts are trending.

## Starter metric catalog

| Metric | Description | Source | Refresh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signal Volume | # of curated Reddit/Twitter/YouTube conversations this week. | Humyn ingestion | Daily |
| Positive Momentum | % of comments tagged as “praise” or “adoption wins.” | Sentiment model | Daily |
| Blocker Density | # of high-severity objections vs. total threads. | Manual + AI tags | Weekly |
| Campaign Lift | Change in sentiment after a product launch or campaign. | Humyn + GTM data | Weekly |

## Set-up flow

1. Align on the decisions you want to influence (roadmap, messaging, GTM).  
2. Define each metric’s formula, owner, and alert threshold.  
3. Connect supplementary data sources (Mixpanel, HubSpot, Sheets) if you want blended views.  
4. Mirror the metrics inside your dashboard tiles and executive reports.

## Best practices

- Keep the catalog short. Three to five high-signal metrics beat a 20-row spreadsheet.  
- Pair every metric with a link to supporting quotes or threads in Explore.  
- Tag metrics by initiative (e.g., “Onboarding”, “Pricing”, “GTM experiment”) to track impact.  
- Publish a changelog so teams know when formulas or thresholds shift.

## When to iterate

- You’re launching a new persona or market segment.  
- Sentiment trends are shifting faster than your reporting cadence.  
- Leadership requests a new view for board or investor updates.
