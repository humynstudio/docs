## Overview

Humyn automatically clusters conversations into themes and extracts representative keywords. Use this view to watch which topics are accelerating, which arguments resonate, and where gaps are forming.

## How to work

- **Review clusters** — Each tile groups similar comments so you can scan summaries before diving in.  
- **Drill into keywords** — Click a keyword to open the exact quotes driving that phrase.  
- **Track movement** — Compare theme volume week over week to surface emerging needs.  
- **Save views** — Capture filters for specific personas, channels, or product areas.
