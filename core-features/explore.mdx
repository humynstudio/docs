## Why Explore

Explore is where <mark>researchers</mark> and <mark>storytellers</mark> live. It lets you peel back the <mark>AI summaries</mark> and get eyes on the conversations themselves—perfect for crafting decks, validating hunches, and finding the quote that seals the argument.

## How the table works

Explore centers on a live table of every curated comment. Each row shows:

- **<mark>Topic</mark>** — the conversation cluster or theme Humyn assigned.  
- **<mark>Source</mark>** — where the comment came from, whether Reddit, Twitter, or YouTube.  
- **<mark>Aspect</mark>** — the focal dimension of the conversation (e.g., features, usability, price, customization).  
- **<mark>Weight</mark>** — the relative importance Humyn assigns based on engagement and relevance.  
- **<mark>Date added</mark>** — when the comment landed in your workspace.

/>

Use filters for <mark>sentiment</mark>, <mark>aspect</mark>, <mark>keywords</mark>, or <mark>time ranges</mark> to focus the grid on the moment that matters.

## Detailed Comment Analysis

Every comment card surfaces the metadata you need to act fast:

- <mark>Keywords</mark> that triggered the match, so you know which prompt or aspect pulled it in.  
- Inline <mark>sentiment highlights</mark> that pinpoint praise, blockers, and questions line by line.  
- A concise <mark>AI recap</mark> that captures the takeaway in one sentence.  
- A direct <mark>source link</mark> so you can jump into Reddit, Twitter, or YouTube for full context when needed.
