## Choosing the Right Tier

- **Free** — Perfect for founders or researchers exploring a single market. Set up two projects (e.g., core product + competitor) and monitor a few targeted communities.  
- **Basic** — Best for seed and Series A teams that need weekly intelligence. The 1,000 comment allowance supports recurring scans across several personas, and unlimited AI chat keeps synthesis fast for roadmap or content planning.  
- **Pro** — Designed for agencies, consultancies, or in-house insight teams running simultaneous initiatives. Larger comment volumes support market sweeps, and priority support ensures quick help during launches.

## Billing Operations

- Humyn charges plans annually to keep pricing predictable. You can cancel or upgrade at any time; prorated credits apply when moving up a tier.  
- Payment methods: major credit cards today, ACH and invoicing for Pro/Enterprise coming soon.  
- The billing owner can download receipts and manage payment information directly inside the app.

## Seat & Access Policy

- Assign a **workspace owner** to manage tiers and usage monitoring.  
- Grant seats on demand—if a project needs more collaborators, invite them without worrying about license fees.  
- Review usage monthly so you can forecast when it’s time to upgrade to Basic or Pro.

## Compliance & Data Handling

| Control | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Data residency | Humyn stores data in US regions. Flag deviations for legal review. |
| Community data | Confirm your legal team approves storing Reddit/Twitter/YouTube excerpts. |
| Access logs | Export user activity quarterly for security verification. |
| Privacy requests | Route takedown or deletion requests to support@humyn.space. |

## Renewal Playbook

- 90 days before renewal: Capture impact metrics (insights shipped, campaigns influenced, roadmap changes).  
- 60 days out: Reassess plan fit—if you frequently hit comment limits, consider upgrading.  
- 30 days out: Confirm payment method, document stakeholder approvals, and note any contract adjustments.

## Reporting Rhythm

- **Monthly digest:** Usage vs. allocation, new projects launched, notable insights produced.  
- **Quarterly briefing:** Adoption by function, tier fit, and recommendations for next quarter.  
- **Ad hoc updates:** Alert finance and leadership if you’re trending toward limits mid-cycle.
