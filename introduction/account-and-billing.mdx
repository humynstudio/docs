## Billing Operations

- Humyn charges plans annually to keep pricing predictable. You can cancel or upgrade at any time; prorated credits apply when moving up a tier.  
- Payment methods: major credit cards today, ACH and invoicing for Pro/Enterprise coming soon.  
- The billing owner can download receipts and manage payment information directly inside the app.

## Seat & Access Policy

- Assign a **workspace owner** to manage tiers and usage monitoring.  
- Grant seats on demand—if a project needs more collaborators, invite them without worrying about license fees.  
- Review usage monthly so you can forecast when it’s time to upgrade to Basic or Pro.

## Compliance & Data Handling
