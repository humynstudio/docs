## Launch in five moves

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Request access" icon="key">
    Confirm your invite, enable 2FA, and add the core collaborators who will review themes or share recaps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Pick communities" icon="satellite-dish">
    Start with two or three subreddits or channels that already spark debate—enough variety to show value without noise.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Seed prompts" icon="question">
    Drop in questions like “What blocks onboarding?” or “How are founders using Humyn?” so the model knows the jobs to solve.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Validate insights" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Skim the generated cards, verify sentiment tags, and bookmark the quotes you want to reuse.
  </Card>
  <Card title="5. Share the story" icon="paper-plane">
    Pin the best insight to a board, pair it with a Loom or summary, and send it to stakeholders the same day.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Workspace setup ritual

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep the system clean" icon="wand-magic">
    Standardize workspace name, brand color, and timezone so reports look consistent when exported or shared.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clarify ownership" icon="people-group">
    Assign who monitors daily vs. weekly, and tag collaborators by function so alerts land with the right person.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Template the recap" icon="note-sticky">
    Save a baseline report layout—hero insight, supporting quotes, open questions—so every update follows the same rhythm.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Front-load governance" icon="shield-halved">
    Agree on approval thresholds and review cadence before scaling ingestion to avoid rework later.
  </Card>
</Columns>
