## Launch Checklist

1. **Request workspace access**  
   Confirm your invite email, set up 2FA, and add up to five collaborators.

2. **Select focus communities**  
   Start with two or three high-signal subreddits, Twitter Lists, or YouTube channels.

3. **Drop in your first prompts**  
   Use conversational prompts like “What are people struggling with during onboarding?” or “How do founders describe AI productivity tools?”.

4. **Review instant insights**  
   Head to the dashboard to confirm Humyn captured the right themes, quotes, and sentiment trends.

5. **Share the narrative**  
   Pin insights to a workspace board and ship a quick Loom or summary doc to stakeholders.
